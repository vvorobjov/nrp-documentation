  You can start the corresponding simulation by pressing the **Launch** button.

  Launching a simulation will enable you to edit the simulation's configuration, like transfer functions, 
  state machines (experiment work flow) or the environment. You will be redirected to the simulation page as an "owner" 
  (`Simulation view`_). If no server slot is available, the button will be greyed out and 
  you will have to wait for a slot.

|

  You can also **Delete** the cloned experiment or make a new copy of it by pressing the **Clone** button.

**Experiment files** tab gives you access to your storage space.

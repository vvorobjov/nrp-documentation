        NEST is a simulator for spiking neural network models that focuses on the dynamics, size and structure of neural systems rather than on the exact morphology of individual neurons. Check more at `NEST web-site <https://www.nest-simulator.org/>`_.

    NEST Desktop 
        NEST Desktop is a web-based GUI application for NEST Simulator, an advanced simulation tool for the computational neuroscience. Check more at `NEST Desktop documentation <https://nest-desktop.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.

    NEST Server
        NEST Server enables users to interact with the NEST simulation engine via a RESTful API. Check more at `NEST Server documentation <https://nest-simulator.readthedocs.io/en/v3.4/connect_nest/nest_server.html>`_.

Thank you for giving an interest in the :term:`Neurorobotics Platform`. In this documentation, we will try to make you familiar with the :abbr:`NRP(Neurorobotics Platform)` and guide you to start working with the platform.

.. rubric:: General goals

The :term:`Neurorobotics Platform`'s purpose is to offer neuroscientists a tool to perform in-silico cognitive or lower-level neural experiments on virtual Guinea pigs, be them biologically inspired or not. It will, on the other side, provide roboticists with the possibility to experiment on their robots with brain models instead of classical controllers.

The platform will provide them with:

- Virtual bodies (robots, bio-inspired)
- Virtual environments to make them live
- Interactive tools to connect these to a brain model
- Interactive tools to design and program their experiment
- Graphical monitors and loggers

.. rubric::Organization of the manual

This manual will help the users to get comfortable with the Experiment Simulation Viewer. It is divided into chapters that cover the main features. The manual does not have to be read linearly.

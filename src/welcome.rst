Welcome
=======

Thank you for giving an interest in the Neurorobotics Platform. In this documentation, we will try to make you familiar with the NRP (Neurorobotics Platform) and guide you to start working with the platform.

General goals
=============

The Neurorobotics Platform's purpose is to offer neuroscientists a tool to perform in-silico cognitive or lower-level neural experiments on virtual Guinea pigs, be them biologically inspired or not. It will, on the other side, provide roboticists with the possibility to experiment on their robots with brain models instead of classical controllers.

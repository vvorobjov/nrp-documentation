Getting started
===============

In order to start working with NRP-core, the latter must be first compiled and installed. The installation guide can be found in the following page: :ref:`Installation Instructions <doxid-installation>`

We provide a number of example experiments within the NRP-core repository. They are located in the ``examples`` subdirectory. They give a good overview of the capabilities of the NRP and should be relatively easy to adapt to user-specific needs. More details about running these experiments can be found on the page: :ref:`Running the example experiments <doxid-running_example_exp>`.

Please take note that some of the examples may require additional models or dependencies, which may be not included in the NRP-core repository. More information can be found in our :ref:`guide <doxid-tutorial_helpful_info>`.

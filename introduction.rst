General goals
-------------

The Neurorobotics Platform's purpose is to offer neuroscientists a tool to perform in-silico cognitive or lower-level neural experiments on virtual Guinea pigs, be them biologically inspired or not. It will, on the other side, provide roboticists with the possibility to experiment on their robots with brain models instead of classical controllers.

The platform will provide them with:

- Virtual bodies (robots, bio-inspired)
- Virtual environments to make them live
- Interactive tools to connect these to a brain model
- Interactive tools to design and program their experiment
- Graphical monitors and loggers

Organization of the manual
--------------------------

This manual will help the users to get comfortable with the Experiment Simulation Viewer. It is divided into chapters that cover the main features. The manual does not have to be read linearly.

Software and hardware requirements
--------------------------------------------------------

The software has been tested against OS/browsers that are listed below. Other profiles may function correctly, but they have not been tested. In any case, there is no risk for your computer. Just try and enjoy!

Hardware requirements are:

- a fairly recent graphics card
- minimum 4Gb of RAM
- a recent browser supporting OpenGL
- check that hardware acceleration is enabled. In Firefox, type about:support in the URL bar, and check under "Graphics", it should say "GPU Accelerated Linux: 1/1", else check
  in the browser documentation for support. In Chrome, the URL is chrome://gpu


Release 2.0 (March 2018)
--------------------------------------------------------
Release 2.0 enhances usability and enables to create experiments from scratch.

- Yet bigger resources (120+ servers)

Release 1.2 (April 2017)
---------------------------------------
Release 1.2 comes with a more stable platform and new template experiments.

The new features include:

- A new brain visualizer, where you can view the neuron populations in various geometrical setups, as well as the spiking neurons in real time
- A new graphical functions editor, where you can view and manipulate the transfer functions while being able to view all the available ROS topics
- Support for bigger brain models
- A new Python API (Virtual Coach) for batch simulations that can be used to launch simulations without a frontend client
- A graphical object scaling capability
- Streaming of robot camera images 
- Environment enhancements
- New experiments available

  + Husky with neuronal red detection : the color detection is done with a neuronal image recognition.

Release 1.1 (October 2016)
---------------------------------------
Release 1.1 offers better stability, higher performance, a new navigation mode, several new experiments and improved graphics.

New features include:

- a new log console to help in debugging transfer functions and state machine scripts.
- a new 3D environment panel where you can apply color filtering, skyboxes, ambient occlusion and more.
- support for high quality 3D materials through PBR (Physically Based Rendering).
- more responsive user interface, thanks to the introduction of a proxy server.
- faster loading time due to optimized 3D models.
- avatar navigation.
- new experiments available:

  + Force based joint control : a simple example of a force based spiking interface for the Schunk SVH robotic hand
  + HoLLiE hand motion with CPG: a basic implementation of CPG driven motion control for the five fingers of a robotic hand
  + Mouse Braitenberg experiment in biology lab: an experiment that loads the soft-skin mouse model in a biology lab environment
  + Empty template Husky experiment : an empty experiment with no brain that can be used as the basis of an experiment
  + Empty template iCub experiment : an empty experiment with no brain that can be used as the basis of an experiment
